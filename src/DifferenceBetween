Final, Finally, Finalize

Final:
It is modifier for classes, methods and variables.
Class declared as Final, we cannot extend that class.
Method declared cannot be override.
Variable declared cannot be changed, becoes constant.

Finally:
A block used after Try and catch. Which runs evry time. to clean up code.

Finalize:
Its a garbage collector method, called before destroying the object to clean up activity.

***************************************
String, String buffer, String builder

String

Immutable: once created, its value cannot be changed.
Thread-safe by default.
Slower for frequent modifications due to creation of new objects.

StringBuffer

Mutable: content can be changed.
Thread-safe (synchronized methods).
Slower than StringBuilder due to synchronization overhead.

StringBuilder

Mutable like StringBuffer.
Not thread-safe.
Faster than StringBuffer; preferred in single-threaded scenarios

***********************************************

Difference between "== operator" and "equals() method" in java
== Operator

Compares references (memory addresses) for objects.
For primitive types, compares actual values.
Checks whether both variables point to the same object.

"equals() method":
Compares content / logical equality of objects.
****************************************************

Access Specifiers vs Access Modifiers
Access Specifiers:
who can access a class, method, variable, or constructor.
like; public, protected, private

Access Modifiers:
How a class, method, or variable behaves, not visibility.
static, final, abstract
******************************************************
🔹 Exception VS Error

Exceptions are recoverable conditions that applications can handle. unhandeled or handeled.
Errors are serious JVM-level problems that applications should not attempt to handle. Occurs at runtime.
