/*  Abstract vs Inheritence
üèóÔ∏è Inheritance is the mechanism (how a child class gets stuff from a parent).
üé≠ Abstract class is a type of parent class that provides incomplete design functionality to be finished by child classes.
	 Why WebDriver is an interface and not an abstract class?
     You can easily switch from Chrome to Firefox without changing your core logic ‚Äî just create a new subclass.
Abstract:
 An abstract class is a parent class that cannot be instantiated. CANNOT CREATE OBJECT OF ABSTRACT CLASS.
It is meant to be inherited and completed by child classes.
It‚Äôs used for abstraction ‚Äî hiding implementation and showing only the structure. 
Add abstract keyword for class and its methods, use extends keyword for subclasses.
if we remove abstract keywords and add method body in abstract method of animal then this will work as override

Abstract vs Interface:
All the methods in Abstract class can be abstract. All the Methods in Interface are always abstract by default.
We can extend (abstract) only one class to be parent of a subclass but we can implement as many as possible.
We do not need to initiate variables in abstarct class to use in child. In interface we have to initiate variables that do not change afterwards.
